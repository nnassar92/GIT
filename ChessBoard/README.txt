Hello!

This is the assignment concerning the knight board. All levels are working fine. The last level works for small boards but takes a lot of time for bigger ones. 

To launch the programs type in make in the command line. You will get 4 files: level1, level3, level4, and level5. These executables can be run be entering ./level1 for example in the command line. 

The optimal cost path algorithm works using the Dijkstra algorithm. The longest path algorithm tests all possible paths to see which one is the longest.

I tried to limit the time working on the assignment to 10 hours. The things that I can improve if I have more time are:

1- Write the code in a more concise and efficient way.
2- Some functions do almost the same job so maybe combine them together.
3- Think of a more efficient algorithm for the last level. Although it works well for small boards, the algorithm does not scale well.

Please feel free to email me at nnassar92@gmail.com if you have any questions about the program.

Cheers and enjoy!
